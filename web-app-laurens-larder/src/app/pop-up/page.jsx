                    Our catering trailer has been a regular at the Sunday Market, serving up fresh breaky burgers that keep locals coming back. You might have also seen us at community events, especially if youâ€™ve tried our famous loaded nachos. The trailer is available to book for private functions, from small celebrations to larger events.
